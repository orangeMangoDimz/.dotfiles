# Sidebar Expand on Hover

## Description

**Important:** set the browser layout to Single Toolbar or Multiple Toolbar depending on how the expanded sidebar should look like.

With this mod the sidebar expands when you hover it. It only works when the browser layout setting is set to collapsed toolbar.

Addionally this mod collapses the buttons below the tabs to provide a smoother experience. Per default your active workspace is shown while the sidebar is collapsed (only works when the workspace switcher is placed there).

## Preferences
- **Hide top workspace indicator**: since the active workspace is already shown below, this theme hides the workspace indicator at the top, if you don't want this: deactivate this setting. *(default: on)*
- **Collapse the buttons to only show current workspace**: If you don't wish for your buttons to only show your current workspace when collapsed: deactivate this setting and it shows the first button instead when collapsed *(default: on)*
- **Inverted Tab Direction**: Favicon on the right, title in the middle, close button on the left. Less moving parts when the sidebar is on the right. *(default: off)*
- **Width of the expanded sidebar**: Here you can change the width of the expanded sidebar *(default: 300px)*
- **Transition speed of the sidebar**: Speed of the collapsing/expanding animation *(default: 120ms)*
